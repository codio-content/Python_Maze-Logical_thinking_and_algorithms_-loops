|||definition
In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that are continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

## Example
Let's use our game as a way of showing an example of a loop.

We want to create an empty maze then add in 10 walls. From our earlier Units, we know we could do the following.

```python
createEmptyMaze()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
```

Now, imagine we wanted to add 100 walls. We would have a LOT of lines of code for doing something that is purely repetitive.
